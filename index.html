Hey there! This is the CDN for Firetime sites. If you don't know what a CDN is, then I'll tell you. 
CDN stands for content delivery network,it'ss a group of servers holding your content for sites
so they can use that content later on. traditinaly you would use someone like Cloudflare to hold
and host your content. But I'm running it through my own servers and just saving it onGitHubb so
I always have a backup. It would normally be way easier to go through cloudflare but I'll just
do it my way for now. See ya later!
